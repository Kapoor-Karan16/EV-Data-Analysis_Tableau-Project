# EV-Data-Analysis_Tableau-Project

âš¡ Electric Vehicle (EV) Analysis â€“ Tableau Project
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) data to uncover trends in EV adoption, manufacturer performance, regional growth, and vehicle specifications. The goal was to transform raw data into actionable insights using Excel for cleaning and modeling, followed by advanced data visualization in Tableau.

Through this project, I aimed to simulate a real-world scenario where a data analyst helps stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, manufacturers, sustainability teams) make data-driven decisions related to the EV market.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used

Microsoft Excel â€“ Data cleaning, transformation, and modeling

Tableau â€“ Interactive dashboards and visualizations


ðŸ§© Project Workflow

Data Cleaning (Excel):

Removed duplicates, standardized formats (e.g., date, state names, vehicle types)
Handled missing values and ensured consistency in manufacturer and model fields
Filtered out irrelevant or incomplete records for a clean dataset

Data Modeling (Excel):

Structured data into well-organized tables for seamless Tableau integration
Created derived columns such as vehicle age, region classification, and EV category
Performed preliminary analysis to identify patterns and variables of interest
Data Visualization (Tableau):
Imported the cleaned dataset into Tableau

Created interactive visualizations using charts, maps, and KPIs to explore:

Growth of EV adoption over time
Distribution of EVs by state and region
Top manufacturers and most popular models
Fuel type comparisons (BEV vs. PHEV vs. Hybrid)
Vehicle class and weight trends

Dashboard Design:

Developed a clean, user-friendly dashboard with filters for region, manufacturer, year, and vehicle type
Included tooltips and dynamic titles for better context
Optimized for both technical and non-technical stakeholders

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights & Outcomes

EV adoption saw consistent growth after 2015, with a sharp rise post-2019
California, Washington, and Oregon led in EV registrations
Tesla and Nissan emerged as top manufacturers in terms of volume
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are growing faster than Plug-in Hybrids (PHEVs)
Most EVs fall under light-duty vehicles, suitable for urban and commuter use

ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to manage a complete data analysis pipelineâ€”from cleaning and modeling data in Excel to building professional, interactive dashboards in Tableau. It showcases skills in identifying meaningful trends, creating visual narratives, and delivering insights that can guide policy, investment, and sustainability decisions in the electric vehicle industry.
